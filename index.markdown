# Hi, I am [Nuo] ðŸ‘‹

I'm a multi-passionate entrepreneur and developer with a foundation in electromobility engineering and a deep love for technology that moves â€” whether it's powered by batteries or by brilliant code. I currently run three companies: milu AB, bridging trade between Sweden and China; Tant Anci och FrÃ¶ken Sara AB, a venture in organic dining and cafÃ© culture; and Kafe AI, my latest project where I'm building intelligent solutions at the intersection of hospitality and machine learning.

Though I started as a coding enthusiast fluent in Python and obsessed with embedded systems and EVs, I've grown into someone who blends business insight with software craftsmanship. I'm currently studying Software Development for Mobility Services (Mjukvaruutvecklare inriktning mobilitetstjÃ¤nster) to sharpen my development skills and deepen my impact in the AI space.

I believe in writing clean code, brewing bold ideas, and building things â€” from scratch â€” that matter.
