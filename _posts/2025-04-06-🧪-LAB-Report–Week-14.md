## üß† **Activities Completed**

### Python 100 Days ‚Äì Day 9‚Äì15:

- **Day 9: Secret Auction**
  - This project simulated a secret auction system where users can input their bids and decide whether to continue bidding. It helped me practice handling user input and storing information using dictionaries. It also reinforced my understanding of conditional statements, loops, and data structures like dictionaries.
- **Day 10: Calculator**
  - In this project, I built a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The challenge was to structure the code so the calculator could keep running until the user chose to exit. This project helped me reinforce my understanding of functions, handling user inputs, and managing operators.
- **Day 11: Blackjack**
  - The Blackjack game simulated a card game where the program compares the player's and dealer's scores to determine the winner. It helped me become more familiar with Python's random number generation, loops, and how to design game logic. It was a fun and insightful challenge.
- **Day 12: Number Guessing**
  - This project involved creating a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the system provides feedback (whether the number is too high or too low). It allowed me to practice using conditional statements for logical decision-making and introduced me to random number generation and limiting the number of guesses.
- **Day 13: Debugging**
  - This was an incredibly useful exercise where I had to identify and fix errors in a given piece of code. It improved my debugging skills and helped me become more adept at reviewing and fixing code. It also enhanced my ability to understand code flow and detect logical errors more effectively.
- **Day14: Higher or Lower**
  - In this game, the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower. This project helped me further understand how to design an interactive game and utilize control flow and conditional statements to implement game logic.
- **Day 15: The Coffee Machine Project**
  - This is a more complex project where I built a coffee machine system that allows users to choose from different types of coffee and pay for their choices. It involved managing inventory, handling financial calculations, and interacting with the user. It was a great exercise for practicing object-oriented programming and designing a more intricate system with multiple functionalities.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

- **On Python:**
    
    - Repeated coding helps develop muscle memory
        
    - Repeated learning of basic functions such as while loop, for loop
        
- **On Machine Learning:**
    
    - The theory is abstract at first, maybe it will become clearer through code practice
        
    - The algorithm part is fascinating
        
- **Challenges:**
    
    - I need to master the use of basic functions of Python
        
    - The amount of code is getting bigger and bigger, and there is not enough time

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

- Continue Python Days 16‚Äì22: Next week I will enter the intermediate level of Python
    
- K√∂rkort online
    
- Completed a Python project report and updated it to my personal website
