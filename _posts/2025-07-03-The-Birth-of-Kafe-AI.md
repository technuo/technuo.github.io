# The Birth of Kafe AI: From a Coffee Shop Owner's Struggles to an AI-Powered Management Platform

## It All Started with a Problem

I've been running my own coffee shop for 7 years now. Throughout these years, I've had to handle massive amounts of sales data every month â€“ daily revenue statistics, receipt organization, inventory management, customer order processing, and generating various reports. I constantly worry about how much milk to order, how many coffee beans to stock, and whether ingredients are about to expire. Sometimes I over-order and waste money; other times I under-order and run out of stock, leaving customers disappointed.

This reality made me reflect: In an era where AI technology is advancing at breakneck speed, why are so many small businesses still managing their operations in the most primitive ways?

## What Our Research Revealed

Driven by this question, we visited dozens of coffee shops, small restaurants, and retail stores. The findings were shocking:

- **95% of small merchants** still rely on manual records or simple Excel spreadsheets
- **Spend 2-3 hours daily** on data organization and analysis
- **Inventory waste rates of 10-15%**, especially for perishable goods
- **Lack scientific forecasting models**, frequently experiencing stockouts or overstock

More importantly, we discovered that these merchants weren't unwilling to embrace technology â€“ rather:
- Existing POS systems are overly complex and expensive
- There's a lack of intelligent analysis tools designed for small businesses
- They need solutions that are both simple and powerful

## The Vision Behind Kafe AI
