In a charging station system, automatically recognizing **battery specifications** (such as battery type, capacity, and charging status) and applying the **best charging strategy** is crucial for improving charging efficiency, protecting the battery, and extending its lifespan. By utilizing **smart detection technology** and **algorithms**, the system can dynamically adjust charging parameters (such as voltage and current) based on the real-time battery state.

## **1. System Overview**

The charging station identifies the **battery specifications** through **charging gun insertion detection** and **battery information retrieval**, then applies the **optimal charging strategy**. The process includes:

- **Upon plugging in the charging gun**, the system detects the connected device (EV or battery type).
- Based on the device type and battery status, it selects the **appropriate charging mode** (e.g., constant current, constant voltage, pulse charging).
- It **monitors real-time battery parameters** (voltage, temperature, SOC – State of Charge) and adjusts charging strategies accordingly to ensure safe and efficient charging.

## **2. Key Technologies and Hardware**

### **(1) Charging Gun Insertion Detection**

- **Current/Voltage Sensors**: Detect whether the charging gun is inserted.
- **Contact Signal Detection**: Uses contact points or sensors to determine proper insertion.

### **(2) Battery Information Identification**

- **CAN Bus Protocol**: Many EVs and battery systems use CAN bus communication. The charging station retrieves **battery type, voltage, temperature, and SOC** via CAN.
- **Battery Management System (BMS) Communication**: BMS exchanges battery details with the charging station using communication protocols like I2C or SPI.

### **(3) Charging Strategy Matching**

Based on the detected battery information, different **charging strategies** are applied:

- **Constant Current Charging** – Used in the initial phase when the battery is at a low charge level.
- **Constant Voltage Charging** – Applied after the battery reaches a certain charge level to maintain a steady voltage.
- **Trickle Charging** – Used when the battery is nearly full to prevent overcharging.
- **Temperature-Controlled Charging** – Adjusts charging parameters based on battery temperature to prevent overheating.

## **3. Implementation Plan**

Using **STM32** and **CAN bus** to read battery information and select an appropriate charging strategy. The **Battery Management System (BMS)** communicates with the charging station.

### **(1) Charging Gun Insertion Detection**

Detects if the charging gun is inserted using **GPIO pins** (connected to a contact sensor).

```c
#define CHARGER_INSERT_PIN GPIO_PIN_0  // Charging gun insertion signal

void detectChargerInsertion() {
    if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOA, CHARGER_INSERT_PIN) == GPIO_PIN_SET) {
        // Charging gun detected, proceed with battery information retrieval
        readBatteryInfo();
    }
}
```

### **(2) Retrieving Battery Information**

Reads battery state via **CAN bus** communication. Assuming the CAN bus is configured to retrieve data from the **Battery Management System (BMS)**.

```c
#include "can.h"  // Include CAN bus library

void readBatteryInfo() {
    // Retrieve battery voltage, temperature, and SOC (State of Charge)
    uint32_t batteryVoltage = readCanData(BMS_VOLTAGE_ID);
    uint32_t batteryTemperature = readCanData(BMS_TEMP_ID);
    uint32_t batterySOC = readCanData(BMS_SOC_ID);

    // Match charging strategy based on battery parameters
    selectChargingStrategy(batteryVoltage, batteryTemperature, batterySOC);
}
```

### **(3) Selecting the Charging Strategy**

Based on battery voltage, temperature, and SOC, the system selects the optimal charging mode.

```c
void selectChargingStrategy(uint32_t voltage, uint32_t temperature, uint32_t soc) {
    if (voltage < 3200) {
        // Low battery voltage – Use constant current charging
        setChargingMode(CURRENT_MODE);
    } else if (voltage >= 3200 && voltage < 4000) {
        // Medium voltage – Use constant voltage charging
        setChargingMode(VOLTAGE_MODE);
    } else if (voltage >= 4000) {
        // Nearly full – Switch to trickle charging
        setChargingMode(TRICKLE_MODE);
    }
    
    if (temperature > 45) {
        // High temperature detected – Enable temperature-controlled charging
        enableTemperatureControl();
    }

    if (soc >= 90) {
        // SOC above 90% – Use trickle charging
        setChargingMode(TRICKLE_MODE);
    }
}
```

### **(4) Charging Mode Switching**

Adjusts the charging station’s output voltage and current based on the selected charging strategy to ensure safe and efficient charging.

```c
void setChargingMode(uint8_t mode) {
    switch (mode) {
        case CURRENT_MODE:
            // Set to constant current mode (e.g., 10A)
            setChargingCurrent(10);
            break;
        case VOLTAGE_MODE:
            // Set to constant voltage mode (e.g., 4.2V)
            setChargingVoltage(4.2);
            break;
        case TRICKLE_MODE:
            // Set to trickle charging mode (e.g., 1A)
            setChargingCurrent(1);
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}

void setChargingCurrent(uint8_t current) {
    // Configure hardware to set charging current
}

void setChargingVoltage(float voltage) {
    // Configure hardware to set charging voltage
}
```
