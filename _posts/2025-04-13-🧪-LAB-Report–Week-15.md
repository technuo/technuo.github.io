## 📍 **Objective (Goal)**

This week focused on continued progress in Python development, knowledge base building, and exploration in cognitive science and creative thinking through reading.

---

## 🧠 **Activities Completed**

I made steady progress on the **Python 100 Days** challenge, completing Days 16 through 22.

### 📘 Projects Completed:
- **Day 16–17**: *Quiz Game* – Implemented using OOP, with structured classes for question data, game loop, and scoring.
- **Day 18–19**: *Hirst Painting* – Explored the `turtle` graphics module and RGB color extraction to generate a dot-painting style artwork.
- **Day 20–21**: *Snake Game* – Split across two days, involving class-based design, keyboard interaction, collision detection, and scoring system.
- **Day 22**: *Pong Game* – A classic two-player paddle game built using the `turtle` module, including ball physics, boundary reflection, paddle movement, and a scoreboard.

### 🔧 Key Concepts & Tools:
`class` / `inheritance` / `turtle.Screen()` / `onkey()` / `collision detection` / `game loop` / `object-oriented design`

### 💡 Key Takeaways:
- Creating a **Breakdown Report** before coding has significantly improved my efficiency and reduced debugging time.
- I’m now more comfortable managing multiple objects, handling interactions like ball-to-paddle collisions and scoring resets.
- The Pong Game helped reinforce concepts like real-time updates, direction control, and interactive inputs.

## 🗂️ 2. Knowledge Management – Obsidian Library

- Created a dedicated **Python 100 Days Library** in Obsidian to document each project.
- Notes include: project goals, structure diagrams, core logic explanations, and post-project reflections.
- Using backlinks and tags to build a personal programming knowledge graph.

## 📖 3. Reading & Thinking

### 🧠 AI Research – Anthropic Paper  
**Title**: *Tracing the Thoughts of a Large Language Model*  

### 🌱 *Tiny Experiments* by Anne-Laure Le Cunff

## ✅ **Thinking**

- “Start tiny. Stay consistent. Think clearly. Create freely.”
